# Overview

# Project Overview: SourceScribe

## 1. Project Purpose

SourceScribe is a powerful documentation generation tool that helps software teams create comprehensive, user-friendly technical documentation for their projects. By analyzing source code and extracting key information, SourceScribe automatically generates detailed documentation that includes visual diagrams, workflow explanations, and practical examples.

The primary goal of SourceScribe is to simplify the documentation process and ensure that developers, engineers, and other stakeholders have easy access to the information they need to understand and work with a codebase.

## 2. Target Users

SourceScribe is designed for the following users:

- **Software Developers**: SourceScribe helps developers quickly onboard to new projects, understand complex codebases, and share their work with others.
- **Technical Writers**: SourceScribe streamlines the documentation process, allowing technical writers to focus on creating high-quality, user-centric content rather than spending time on manual data gathering.
- **Project Managers**: SourceScribe provides a comprehensive overview of a project's features and capabilities, enabling project managers to better understand and communicate the system's functionality.
- **Stakeholders**: SourceScribe's visual diagrams and process-oriented documentation make it easier for non-technical stakeholders to grasp the inner workings of a software system.
